Stage (window) -> Scene (?) -> Pane -> Controls
(every stage must have a scene).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE

Represented by the Stage class.
Top most container in which a javaFx user interface appears. 
(eg In Windows/Mac it is a window. On a smartphone it is usually the full screen)
When a JavaFx application is launched, a stage (known as 'primary stage') is created...
and passed to the start() method as a parameter. 
eg.  start(primaryStage)
The stage houses the scene, which contains the controls and/or other user-interface node.

COMMONLY USED METHODS OF THE STAGE CLASSES
void close()                         Closes the stage.
void initModality(Modality modality) Sets the modality of the stage. This method must be called 
 (modality: the mode of something)   before the show method is called. 
                                     The modality can be one of the following:
                                     Modality.NONE
                                     Modality.APPLICATION_MODAL
                                     Modality.WINDOW_MODAL
void initStyle(StageStyle style)     Sets the style for the stage. This method must be called
                                     before the show method is called. 
                                     The style can be one of the following:
                                     StageStyle.DECORATED
                                     StageStyle.UNDECORATED

void setIconified(boolean iconified)   Sets the iconified status of the stage. (minimized to icon)
void setMaximized(boolean maximized)   Sets the maximized status of the stage. 
                                       (full screen with title bar, restore, minimize and close buttons) 
void setMaxHeight(double maxheight)    Sets the maximum height for the stage.
void setMaxWidth(double maxwidth)      Sets the maximum width for the stage.
void setMinHeight(double maxheight)    Sets the minimum height for the stage.
void setMinWidth(double maxwidth)      Sets the minimum width for the stage.
void setResizable(boolean resizable)   Sets the fullscreen status of the stage.
void setScene(Scene scene)             Sets the scene to be displayed on the stage.
void setTitle(String title)            Sets the title to be displayed in the stage’s title bar, if a
                                       title bar is visible.
void show()                            Makes the stage visible.
void showAndWait()                     Makes the stage visible and then waits until the stage is
                                       closed before continuing.
void toFront()                         Forces the stage to the foreground.
void toBack()                          Forces the stage to the background.

SCENE

Every JavaFX application uses one or more Scene objects to hold the user interface controls.

Commonly Used Constructors and Methods of the Scene class:

Constructor                 Description
Scene(Parent root)          Creates a new scene with the specified root node
Scene(Parent root, double width, double height)   Creates a new scene with the specified root node,
                                                  width, and height.

Method                      Description
double getHeight()          Gets the height of the scene
double getWidth()           Gets the width of the scene
double getX()               Gets the horizontal position of the scene
double getY()               Gets the vertical position of the screen
void setRoot(Parent root)   Sets the root node


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATING AN ALERT BOX
Display a basic message box using the Alert class (similar to the JOptionPane class)

Commonly Used Constructors and Methods of the Alert class:
Constructor                 Description
Alert(Alert.AlertType)      Creates a new alert of the specified type

Alert(Alert.AlertType, String text)  
                            Creates a new alert of the specified type and sets the message text.

Alert(Alert.AlertType, String text, ButtonType type...)  
                            Creates a new alert and sets the buttons to be displayed.

Method                              Description
void setTitle(String text)          Sets the title
Optional<ButtonType> showAndWait()  Shows the alert and waits for the user’s response, which is 
                                    returned as a ButtonType object.


The AlertType parameter lets you specify one of several types of Alert dialogs:
»» AlertType.CONFIRMATION, which prompts the user to confirm an action.
»» AlertType.ERROR, which display an error message.
»» AlertType.INFORMATION, which displays an information dialog box.
»» AlertType.WARNING, which displays a warning message.
»» AlertType.NONE, which display a generic alert dialog.

You can control what buttons appear on the Alert box by using the optional
ButtonType parameter. You can choose from among the following types of buttons:
»» ButtonType.APPLY
»» ButtonType.CANCEL
»» ButtonType.CLOSE
»» ButtonType.FINISH
»» ButtonType.NEXT
»» ButtonType.NO
»» ButtonType.OK
»» ButtonType.PREVIOUS
»» ButtonType.YES

eg. snippet:

Alert a = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.INFORMATION, "Are you certain?", ButtonType.YES, ButtonType.NO);

In this example, the Alert box will include both a YES and a NO button.
To determine which button the user clicked you must test the value returned by the
'showAndWait()' method. This value is an object of type 'Optional' (since the user can close the
dialog box without clicking the buttons)
Test whether the user clicked a button by calling the 'isPresent()' method.
Then call the 'get()' method to retrieve the actual result.
eg.
    Alert a = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.INFORMATION, "Are you certain?", ButtonType.YES, ButtonType.NO);
    Optional<ButtonType> r = a.showAndWait();
    if (r.isPresent() && r.get() == ButtonType.YES)
    {
        // The user clicked OK!
    }
