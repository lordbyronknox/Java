REGULAR EXPRESSIONS (aka. REGEX)

A simple regex pattern matches a string literal exactly: 
regex: 		 abc
string to match: abc
MATCH!!
string to match: abcd
NOT A MATCH

A CHARACTER CLASS represents a particular type of character, rather than a specific character.
A regex pattern uses 2 types of character class: predefined classes, and custom classes.

REDEFINED:
. 	Any SINGLE character	(eg. c.t will match any 3 letter word that starts with c, ends with t)
\d 	Any digit (0–9)		(eg. Birthdate 31-07-77: /d/d-/d/d-/d/d)
\D 	Any nondigit (anything other than 0–9)
\s 	Any white-space character (space, tab, new line, return, or backspace) (eg. ..\s.. matches ab	bc)
\S 	Any character other than a white-space character ( _ , * ]  etc. )
\w 	Any word character (a–z, A–Z, 0–9, or an underscore)
\W 	Any character other than a word character
