THREADS

The Thread class lets you create an object that can be run as a thread in multithreaded 
java applications.
It has many constructors and methods... the most important ones are:

Thread()                    Creates an instance of the class.
Thread(String name)         Creates a Thread object and assigns a name to the thread.
Thread(Runnable target)     Turns any object that implements an API interface called Runnable, into a thread.
Thread(Runnable target,     Creates a thread from any object that implements Runnable and assigns the specific name to it.
 String name)               
static int activeCount()    Returns the number of active threads.
static int enumerate(Thread[] t)    Fills the specified array with a copy of each active thread. The return value
                                    is the number of threads added to the array.
String getName()            Returns the name of the thread.
int getPriority()           Returns the thread’s priority.
void interrupt()            Interrupts this thread.
boolean isInterrupted()     Checks whether the thread has been interrupted.
void setPriority(int priority)      Sets the thread’s priority.
void setName(String name)   Sets the thread’s name.
static void Sleep           Causes the currently executing thread (int milliseconds) to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds.
void run()                  Is called when the thread is started. Place the code that you want the thread to execute inside this method.
void start()                Starts the thread.
static void yield()         Causes the currently executing thread to yield to other threads that are waiting to execute.
