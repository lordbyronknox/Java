XML
* A standardized way to create, store, exchange between different types of computer systems or programs.
* It uses tags (like HTML). Each tag is an element.
<?xml version='1.0'?>                   //Every xml file must start with a xml declaration. (doesn't need an end tag)
<Books>                                 //root element
    <Book>                                  //start tag (element)
        <Title>Java For Dummies</Title>         //everything between the start and end tag is the
        <Author>Lowe</Author>                   //element's content. (also elements). (can be text data, or more elements)
    </Book>                                 //end tag
</Books>                                //root element

* Two key differences between XML and HTML is that XML tags dont indicate the format of the data, (Bold etc)
  rather they are descriptive, eg. a tag for the title is <title>.
  HTML tags are set... <B> for Bold, <I> for Italic etc.  XML tags can be whatever you feel suits the situation.

* Attributes: You can use an attribute to store data, instead of a child element.
  An attribute is a name-value pair inside the start tag of an element.
  eg. <Book title="Java for Dummies">
